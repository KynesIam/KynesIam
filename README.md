- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cian Reeves and I am a 4th year PhD student in the physics department of UC santa Barbara. My research lies at the interface of condensed matter physics, quantum chemistry and materials science. More specifically I develop techniques to simulate non-equilibrium quantum systems with many-body Green's functions.  I am interested both in the development and application of efficient practical schemes for simulating these types of systems.  In addition to this specific research goal I am interested in quantum systems and the development of various numerical methods to study them.

- My numerical projects are primarily based in C++, but I am proficient in Python and have a working knowledge of other quantum related software packages such as quantum ESPRESSO and Qiskit. Due to the often expensive nature of quantum simulation methods I am also familiar with using openMP for optimizationa and parallelization, and I am constantly improving my knowledge of high performance computing
